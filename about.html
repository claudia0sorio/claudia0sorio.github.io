                    <p>I'm claudia. this is basically a blog i guess, idk. just a collection of things i like and things i want to talk about.</p>

                    <div id="aboutMe">
                        <img id="me" src="images/me.png">
                        <p>I basicallylook like this. well, now that im thinking about it, if youre reading this you probably know what i look like i guess. <br>this is how i look in my mind at least. <br>idk why you would need to know that. do with that information what you will<br><br>
                        You cant personalize the hobbies and talents, idk how to do those things. i just made this on cartoon network.com idk</p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <p>im a big fan of the retro tech vibe. you can probably tell from the everything about me. im getting kind of bored of instagram stories (which says a lot because i love posting stories). idk i want something more permanent. also i want to display it how i want. also i can be as annoying as i want here because im sure only like 4 people total will visit it. also its my website so who gives a fuck. you came here willingly, you cant get annoyed with how much i post. <br><br>anyway, that randomly turned into a rant. LMAO. ok yeah expect cool things because i like cool things and this will be everything i like. <br>very stream of consciousness, very fun. <br>the way the internet used to be. <br><br>thanks. gbye</p>
